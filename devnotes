### Merging a Contributor via Pull

#### Objectives:
* Preserve history; don’t squash to a single commit.
* Provide a paper trail of which contributor merged the contribution.
* Add a VERSION and CHANGELOG entry.

The first thing we want to do is bring our master branch up to date. The
assumption here is that we don’t have any local work done in master; it’s a
clean branch tracking the upstream, so that git pull will simply fast forward
the latest changes.

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull origin master

Next, let’s pull in our contributor’s branch.

    $ git pull --no-ff --no-commit git://github.com/someone/foo.git foo-branch

We use --no-ff to disallow fast forwarding, even if the remote branch is up to
date. This ensures there will always be a merge commit, providing for the paper
trail requirement mentioned earlier. The --no-commit option gives us a chance
to alter the work tree as part of the merge commit. Putting hefty changes here
would be confusing, but it is the perfect chance to make VERSION and CHANGELOG
edits.

    $ edit VERSION and CHANGELOG
    $ git add .

Once the VERSION and CHANGELOG is to your liking, we are ready to finalize
the merge.

    $ git commit

    [bug|feature|issue N] Description

    $ git push

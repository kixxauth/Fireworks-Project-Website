#
# The purpose of this config file is to allow the automatic creation of test
# suites to run with `./testrunner.py`.
#
# config.yaml is a list of possible command line arguments that can be passed
# when executing `testrunner.py`. For example:
#
#   `./testrunner.py full`
#
# Will run all the tests listed under `full`
#
# Each section is followed by a list of modules, followed by a list of class names,
# followed by a list of test functions. For example, the module `url.py` contains a class
# named `RobotsTxt` which contains the test function `get`.

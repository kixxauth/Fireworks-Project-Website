      <p class="description-content">
      Working as a member of The Fireworks Project is not like any other job
      you&#39;ve ever had. Our company was built from the ground up to be an
      employee owned and employee managed corporation. In fact we are
      officially referred to as a &quot;member owned corporation&quot; because
      our members are a unique blend of shareholders and employees.
      </p>
      <p class="description-content">
      We didn&#39;t want venture capitalists and other investors dictating our
      livelihoods, and our unique corporate structure put control of the
      company into the hands of the people who are building it. The downside is
      that we don&#39;t get paid for our efforts until the company is making
      money.  We feel that is a small price to pay for the freedom to have fun
      doing what we love to do and get a life away from work to enjoy the stuff
      that really matters.

    <div id="operating-agreement">
      <h1>LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OPERATING AGREEMENT</h1>
      <h2>Fireworks Technology Projects, LLC (the "Company")</h2>
      <h3>Member-Managed Limited Liability Company</h3>
      <h4>Each Member of the Company agrees to be bound by the following provisions:</h4>
      <h5>Work Product.</h5>
      <p>
      All Members irrevocably transfer and assign all right, title and interest
      to any work product created (now or in the future) in the course of
      Company projects to the Company. In creating any work product for the
      Company or otherwise performing services for the Company, Members shall
      be independent contractors of the Company.
      </p>
      <h5>Point Allocation.</h5>
      <p>
      At the end of the first full calendar quarter following the creation of
      the Company (the "Initial Period"), the founding member(s) (the
      "Founder(s)") shall determine the number of Points to be allocated to
      each Member of the Company (including the Founder(s)) with respect to
      contributions made prior and up to the last day of that quarter. At the
      end of each month thereafter, Active Members, as defined below, or their
      designated representatives shall determine the number of Points to be
      allocated for the month then ended.
      </p>
      <h5>Point Allocation Cap.</h5>
      <p>
      The total number of points allocated from any Active Member to any other
      member during a one month period may not exceed the total number of
      points held at the end of the previous month by the allocating member. 
      </p>
      <h5>Points Received.</h5>
      <p>
      Points received by each Member will be cumulative throughout the life of
      the Company. Members who have received Points during the most recently
      completed month shall be deemed "Active Members".
      </p>
      <h5>Payment of Revenues.</h5>
      <p>
      The Active Members shall decide the amount of revenues to be paid out to
      Members ("Member Payments") during any month, including upon any sale or
      dissolution of the Company. Member Payments shall be paid to Members in
      proportion to the number of Points held by each Member as a percentage of
      all Points outstanding. From time to time, the Active Members may decide
      to multiply all Points by a factor designed to adjust the number of
      Points in light of the size of the membership entitled to receive Points
      or for other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
      Unless otherwise decided by the Company, all Member Payments shall be
      deemed compensation to the Members for their contributions to the Company
      as independent contractors.
      </p>
      <h5>Liability of Members.</h5>
      <p>
      The debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company are solely the
      debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company. A Member will not be
      personally liable for a debt, obligation or liability of the Company
      solely by reason of being or acting as a Member or Active Member.
      </p>
      <h5>Board of Directors.</h5>
      <p>
      The Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company shall consist of 3
      Directors with a decision of 2 Directors controlling. The Board shall be
      appointed and removed by Members holding a majority of the Points held by
      all Members voting on that decision. The Board shall be elected annually.
      No Director shall be compensated for his or her services to the Company
      as such unless agreed by the Active Members. The business and affairs of
      the Company shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board and
      the Company may, by decision of the Board, authorize agents to sign
      documents or otherwise act on its behalf. The Board shall have the power
      to perform all acts which it may deem necessary or advisable for the
      Company, but no Director acting alone shall have the power to bind the
      Company. The Directors and other agents of the Company shall be
      indemnified and held harmless from and against any and all claims,
      expenses, costs, and liabilities which such person may incur in
      connection with his or her duties on behalf of the Company, to the
      maximum extent permitted by the Vermont Limited Liability Company Act
      (the "Act").
      </p>
      <h5>Decisions by Members.</h5>
      <p>
      Other than decisions to be made by the Active Members under other parts
      of this Agreement, a decision of the Members holding a majority of the
      Points held by all Members voting on a specific matter shall be a
      decision of the Members (except as to amendments to this Agreement, as
      described below). The following decisions need approval by the Members:
      (i) election of the Board or removal of members of the Board, (ii)
      amendments to this Agreement or the Articles of Organization of the
      Company (approval of Members with 2/3 of the Points of all voting Members
      required), (iii) sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
      Company, and (iv) dissolution of the Company. The Board shall adopt such
      procedures as it considers reasonable to ensure a fair opportunity to
      vote by Members on specific matters.
      </p>
      <h5>Founder(s) Agreement.</h5>
      <p>
      During the Initial Period, the Founder(s) may cause the Company to enter
      into an agreement with the Founders on such terms as are agreed upon by
      the Founder(s) and are disclosed to the Members.
      </p>
      <h5>Tax Election.</h5>
      <p>
      The Company shall elect to be treated for federal and state income tax
      purposes as a "Subchapter C corporation". The Founder(s) or their
      designee(s) shall be the shareholder(s) (the "Shareholder(s)") of the
      Company for federal and state income tax purposes.
      </p>
      <h5>Choice of Law.</h5>
      <p>

      <p class="description content">
      A career at The Fireworks Project is not like any other job you have ever
      had.  Our company was built from the ground up as an employee owned and
      employee managed corporation.  In fact we call ourselves a member owned
      corporation because all of us are a unique blend of shareholders and
      employees.
      </p>
      <p class="description content">
      We didn't want venture capitalists and investors dictating our livelihoods,
      so we cut them out of the picture.  The downside is that we don't get paid
      for what we do until we make money doing it.  We feel that is a small price
      to pay for the freedom to have fun doing what we love to do and to have a
      life away from work to enjoy the stuff that really matters.

      <h1>LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OPERATING AGREEMENT</h1>
      <h2>Fireworks Technology Projects, LLC (the "Company")</h2>
      <h3>Member-Managed Limited Liability Company</h3>
      <h4>Each Member of the Company agrees to be bound by the following provisions:</h4>
      <h5>Work Product.</h5>
      <p>
      All Members irrevocably transfer and assign all right, title and interest
      to any work product created (now or in the future) in the course of
      Company projects to the Company. In creating any work product for the
      Company or otherwise performing services for the Company, Members shall
      be independent contractors of the Company.
      </p>
      <h5>Point Allocation.</h5>
      <p>
      At the end of the first full calendar quarter following the creation of
      the Company (the "Initial Period"), the founding member(s) (the
      "Founder(s)") shall determine the number of Points to be allocated to
      each Member of the Company (including the Founder(s)) with respect to
      contributions made prior and up to the last day of that quarter. At the
      end of each month thereafter, Active Members, as defined below, or their
      designated representatives shall determine the number of Points to be
      allocated for the month then ended.
      </p>
      <h5>Point Allocation Cap.</h5>
      <p>
      The total number of points allocated from any Active Member to any other
      member during a one month period may not exceed the total number of
      points held at the end of the previous month by the allocating member. 
      </p>
      <h5>Points Received.</h5>
      <p>
      Points received by each Member will be cumulative throughout the life of
      the Company. Members who have received Points during the most recently
      completed month shall be deemed "Active Members".
      </p>
      <h5>Payment of Revenues.</h5>
      <p>
      The Active Members shall decide the amount of revenues to be paid out to
      Members ("Member Payments") during any month, including upon any sale or
      dissolution of the Company. Member Payments shall be paid to Members in
      proportion to the number of Points held by each Member as a percentage of
      all Points outstanding. From time to time, the Active Members may decide
      to multiply all Points by a factor designed to adjust the number of
      Points in light of the size of the membership entitled to receive Points
      or for other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
      Unless otherwise decided by the Company, all Member Payments shall be
      deemed compensation to the Members for their contributions to the Company
      as independent contractors.
      </p>
      <h5>Liability of Members.</h5>
      <p>
      The debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company are solely the
      debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company. A Member will not be
      personally liable for a debt, obligation or liability of the Company
      solely by reason of being or acting as a Member or Active Member.
      </p>
      <h5>Board of Directors.</h5>
      <p>
      The Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company shall consist of 3
      Directors with a decision of 2 Directors controlling. The Board shall be
      appointed and removed by Members holding a majority of the Points held by
      all Members voting on that decision. The Board shall be elected annually.
      No Director shall be compensated for his or her services to the Company
      as such unless agreed by the Active Members. The business and affairs of
      the Company shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board and
      the Company may, by decision of the Board, authorize agents to sign
      documents or otherwise act on its behalf. The Board shall have the power
      to perform all acts which it may deem necessary or advisable for the
      Company, but no Director acting alone shall have the power to bind the
      Company. The Directors and other agents of the Company shall be
      indemnified and held harmless from and against any and all claims,
      expenses, costs, and liabilities which such person may incur in
      connection with his or her duties on behalf of the Company, to the
      maximum extent permitted by the Vermont Limited Liability Company Act
      (the "Act").
      </p>
      <h5>Decisions by Members.</h5>
      <p>
      Other than decisions to be made by the Active Members under other parts
      of this Agreement, a decision of the Members holding a majority of the
      Points held by all Members voting on a specific matter shall be a
      decision of the Members (except as to amendments to this Agreement, as
      described below). The following decisions need approval by the Members:
      (i) election of the Board or removal of members of the Board, (ii)
      amendments to this Agreement or the Articles of Organization of the
      Company (approval of Members with 2/3 of the Points of all voting Members
      required), (iii) sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
      Company, and (iv) dissolution of the Company. The Board shall adopt such
      procedures as it considers reasonable to ensure a fair opportunity to
      vote by Members on specific matters.
      </p>
      <h5>Founder(s) Agreement.</h5>
      <p>
      During the Initial Period, the Founder(s) may cause the Company to enter
      into an agreement with the Founders on such terms as are agreed upon by
      the Founder(s) and are disclosed to the Members.
      </p>
      <h5>Tax Election.</h5>
      <p>
      The Company shall elect to be treated for federal and state income tax
      purposes as a "Subchapter C corporation". The Founder(s) or their
      designee(s) shall be the shareholder(s) (the "Shareholder(s)") of the
      Company for federal and state income tax purposes.
      </p>
      <h5>Choice of Law.</h5>
      <p>
      The law of the State of Vermont shall govern this Agreement without
      reference to its conflicts of law principles.
      </p>
      <h5>Arbitration.</h5>
      <p>
      The Members agree that any and all disputes related to or arising from
      this Agreement will be resolved through online arbitration under the
      rules of and as facilitated by Virtual Mediation and Arbitration System,
      LLC.
      </p>
      <h5>Non-transferability.</h5>
      <p>
      Any interest of a Member in the Company created under this Agreement will
      be non-transferable and shall terminate upon the death of the Member.
      </p>
      <h5>Registered Agent.</h5>
      <p>
      Gravel and Shea is the Company's registered agent in the State of
      Vermont. The registered agent's office is located at 76 St. Paul Street,
      Burlington, VT 05401.
      </p>
      <h5>Designated Office.</h5>
      <p>
      The location of the principal place of business of the Company will be
      the office of the Company's registered agent.
      </p>
      <h5>Termination of Access and Active Membership.</h5>
      <p>
      A Member's status as an Active Member, may be terminated by vote of a
      majority of the votes cast by voting Active Members within 2 weeks after
      such termination is proposed by any Active Member.
      </p>
      <h5>Contracts With Third Parties.</h5>
      <p>
      With the exception of the agreement between the Company and the
      Founder(s) described above, no Member or any other person may sign a
      contract on behalf of the Company unless expressly authorized by a
      decision of the Board to do so, and any contract signed without such
      express authorization will be invalid.
      </p>
      <h5>Duty of Loyalty.</h5>
      <p>
      Because it is the expectation that the Members will be free to engage in
      pursuits outside of the Company, the Members may devote such time to the
      Company as they deem appropriate and may engage in such activities
      outside of the Company as they wish to pursue, including those which may
      compete with the Company.
      </p>
      <h5>Integration.</h5>
      <p>
      This Agreement constitutes the entire operating agreement among the
      parties.
      </p>
      <h4>ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ARBITRATION.</h4>
      <p>
      This Agreement contains an agreement to arbitrate. After entering into
      this agreement, I understand that I will not be able to bring a lawsuit
      concerning any dispute that may arise which is covered by the arbitration
      agreement, unless it involves a question of constitutional or civil
      rights. Instead, I agree to submit any such dispute to an impartial
      arbitrator as described above.

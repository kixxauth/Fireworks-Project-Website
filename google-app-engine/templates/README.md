Django Templates
----------------

The Fireworks Project web app uses Django Templates throughout all of our
dynamic content.

For more information about writing templates, consult the well written [Django
docs][2] on the subject.

For more information on programming the templates you could read through the
Django template [API docs][1] or, perhaps more useful, just have a loot at the
`render_template()` function in `/utils.py`.

All template files should be named with the .html extension like `base.html`.

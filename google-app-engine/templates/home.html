    We are a small band of engineers and designers working together to
    create a great software company. Our goal is to build simple tools for big
    ideas. The Fireworks Project will deliver the systems you need to operate
    your small or medium sized organization more efficiently because, we know
    you have more important things to do.
    </p>
    <p>
    We have been working night and day to bootstrap our software assembly line.
    This one of a kind innovation we allow us to build amazingly productive
    software, customized to the needs of your unique organization, at an
    incredibly affordable price. Best of all, we will be able to deliver your
    systems in an unbelievably short amount of time.

    You can see from the unfinished state of our website that we have been
    night and day in the ugly underbelly of technology so you don't have to. In
    fact, we are working so hard to get this done for you that it was reported
    that one of our engineers forgot to call his mom on mothers' day. We
    regretfully apologize to moms everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
    Although we love working in the guts of computer systems, what really gets
    us fired up is hearing from you. We want to know more about you and your
    organization. If you could have software customized just for you, what
    would it do? What can we do to help you get more done at work so you can
    spend more time with the people that really matter?

Static
======

The static/ folder contains all the files and folders that will be served
statically from the App Engine servers rather than dynamically from python
scripts.  This files include CSS, Images, and downloads of various kinds. None
of these files are available to read or write to or from the filesystem with
Python scripts from the server.

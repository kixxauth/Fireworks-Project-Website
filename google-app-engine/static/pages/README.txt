Static Pages
============

This directory contains a random collection of statically served content.
It is a good place for general HTML publication. Unfortunately it has become
a catch all for anything that needs to get published quickly.

There is an ticket registered ([#8](http://github.com/FireworksProject/www.fireworksproject.com/issues/issue/8)) to resolve this issue.

This folder can be referenced in HTML by an absolute URL like:

    `http://www.fireworksproject.com/pages/`

or the relative URLs like:

    `/pages/` and `../pages/`

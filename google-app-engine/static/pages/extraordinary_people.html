<h2 class="section-head">About The Fireworks Project</h2>

<p>When I founded The Fireworks Project I wanted to create something that attracted the
best and brightest people from all over the world, and I wanted to be sure
that 100% of the value of the company is returned to the people who build it.
I could have tried to get funding from venture capitalists and then set out to
hire great people, but then what would we have? It would be just like any other
job.</p>

<p>So, instead of following the traditional path of a startup I went looking for a
different way. I wanted to create an environment where you could <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html">make
something that people want</a> without being
distracted with layers of management, the exit strategies of venture
capitalists, or the short term expectations of investors. Inspired by the open
software community I finally found a <a href="http://lawlab.org/digital-institutions/vermont-project/">legal structure</a> that suited my vision
for what a corporation could be. Most of all I hope I have provided a channel
for those of you who need a break from the soul sucking nature of what has
become the all too typical career path.</p>

<h3>This is not anything like a typical corporation.</h3>

<p>When you become a member of The Fireworks Project, and have started
contributing some time and effort to the company, the other members will give
you points, which are similar to shares or stock options in a typical
corporation. If your contributions continue to add value to the company, other
members will continue to send more points your way, increasing your
stake in the company.</p>

<p>When the company begins earning revenue, the profit left over after covering
our expenses is divided up amongst all the members. You will get a percentage
of the profits equal to the percentage of the total points you have.  So if you
have 9% of the total points, you'll get 9% of the profits for each month.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to use your points to vote on major management decisions
within the company, like electing the board of directors or selling the
company, just like a shareholder of a typical corporation. Also, just like a
corporate shareholder, if we ever decide to sell the company, you'll get a
percentage of the proceeds from the sale that matches the percentage of the
total points you have.</p>

<p>So, by becoming a member of The Fireworks Project, you are essentially becoming
an employee and a shareholder at the same time.  However, you are not allowed to sell or
transfer your points to anyone else.  This rule was added so that people would
have to contribute to become members, and would not be able to buy their way
in.</p>

<p>So, when we say "increase shareholder value" we really mean our own value and
not that of investors that don't even understand what we do. The Fireworks
Project was created to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html">generate wealth</a> for you, but not for the parasites
that might attach themselves to your innovation and your ability to execute.</p>

The Fireworks Project here: <a href="http://www.fireworksproject.com/join">www.fireworksproject.com/join</a> </p>

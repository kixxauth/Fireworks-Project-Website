Root of the Google App Engine application
=========================================

This folder is the root folder of www.fireworksproject.com as it exists on
Google App Engine.  This is the only folder that GAE cares about. You can run
this web application on your local dev_appserver by pointing it at this
directory (as long as it contains app.yaml). Have a look at the [Google
documentation][1] before getting started.

Important files in this folder include:
---------------------------------------
* app.yaml : The configuration file for the app.
* request.py : Which handles all incoming requests not served by static files.
* index.yaml : Which configures the indexes on the datastore.
(! index.yaml is automatically generated by the dev_appserver and should not be
modified by hand unless you really know what you are doing.)

Your next stop should be to `/google-app-engine/app.yaml`, which is the
configuration file for this application. Or you could have a look at
`request.py` instead. Both are good places to actually start hacking on the
code.

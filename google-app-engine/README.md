Root Google Appengine Folder
============================

This folder is the root folder of the Google App Engine application.

Important files in this folder include:
---------------------------------------
* app.yaml : The configuration file for the app.
* request.py : Which handles all incoming requests not served by static files.
* index.yaml : Which configures the indexes on the datastore.
(! index.yaml is automatically generated by the dev_appserver and should not be
modified by hand unless you really know what you are doing.)

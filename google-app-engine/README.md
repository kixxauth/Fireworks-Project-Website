Root of the Google App Engine application
=========================================

This folder is the root folder of www.fireworksproject.com as it exists on
Google App Engine.  This is the only folder that GAE cares about. You can run
this web application on your local dev_appserver by pointing it at this
directory. Have a look at the [Google documentation][1] before getting started.

Important files in this folder include:
---------------------------------------
* app.yaml : The configuration file for the app.
* request.py : Which handles all incoming requests not served by static files.
* index.yaml : Which configures the indexes on the datastore.
(! index.yaml is automatically generated by the dev_appserver and should not be
modified by hand unless you really know what you are doing.)

The easiest way to start is by pointing your browser to
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) after starting the
dev_appserver and you should be off and running.

The next thing you might want to do is run the automated tests.  The entire
test suite can be run locally by the dev_appserver by executing the Python
script `/test/testrunner.py`.

You can also test the remote staging envronment and run individual suites of
tests from the command line. Take a look at the source of `/test/testrunner.py`
for more juicy details.

Your next stop should be to `/google-app-engine/app.yaml`, which is the
configuration file for this application. From there you should be able to
actually start hacking on the code.

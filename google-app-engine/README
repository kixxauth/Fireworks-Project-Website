This folder is the root folder of the Google App Engine application.  Important
files in this folder include app.yaml which is the configuration file for the
app, request.py which handles all incoming requests not served by static files,
and index.yaml which configures the indexes on the datastore.  ! index.yaml is
automatically generated by the dev_appserver and should not be modified by
hand.
